# Image-Classification-Inception-V3-Animal-10-Dataset-

Inception-v3 is a convolutional neural network architecture from the Inception family that makes several improvements including using Label Smoothing, Factorized 7 x 7 convolutions, and the use of an auxiliary classifer to propagate label information lower down the network (along with the use of batch normalization for layers in the sidehead).


Animal-10 dataset contains about 28K medium quality animal images belonging to 10 categories: dog, cat, horse, spyder, butterfly, chicken, sheep, cow, squirrel, elephant.
